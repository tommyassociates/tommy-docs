## Make Your Own Addon

From start to finish, learn how to build and package a Tommy addon.


### Getting Started

This guide is a work in progress. For now please copy, paste and reverse engineer the existing demo code.

For a very basic addon with just a single view check the Poke addon source code: `/addons/poke`

For a more advanced addon with multiple views and controllers check the Tasks addon source code: `/addons/tasks`. Note that the Tasks addon leverages the [dynamic features](using-the-sdk.md#dynamic-features) of the SDK.


### Using the API

Tommy's full API is at your disposal. It lets you create chats, events, and flexible data schemas that can power the most complex realtime applications.

Again, demo addons are the best reference for getting started. The Tasks addon is a great starting point.

See the [API Reference](ref:///api/index.html)
